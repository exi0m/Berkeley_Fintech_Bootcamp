## Who am I 

My name's Steven Mellor. Im a Senior Site Relibaility Engineer for a data science SAAS platform.

## Career Goals

I’m looking forward to gaining an arsenal of pragmatic approaches to solving but possibly create a platform that can alleviate societal issues that are created by economical barriers. AI and machine learning are a current buzzword but I feel as if we’re barely scratching the surface of potential these fields have already garnished attention to. Budding, evolving python libraries are showing endless capabilities of it’s usage to solve some of the most burdensome challenges to allow even the most basic of users to invent. I want to be challenged outside of my work space and I want to feel the pressure of a time frame for submission. Finance has not been a department I have worked in but in fact one of the most interesting fields for me to put interest in. I’ve been part of cryptocurrency for a few years and want to see the extent that blockchain can take us, where the governance is by the people and not by a hierarchy of wealth. It’s currently just a subject of economic gain by market trading. My main objective is to fall in love with the field I fell into when I was 9 years old and that’s technology as a whole but to progress as quickly as the technology does. There will always be something else to learn and this field is cut throat. Staying a float by being a sponge to newer technologies is what allows you to stay ahead.

## Reason I chose to do this course

The reason I chose to do this course as opposed to going a self-paced route such as datacamp, codecademy and the other coding platforms is because I’ve realized the older I’ve become, I need some type of structural guidance to my learning process. I’m a 37 year old self-taught programmer where the weight of all my other endeavors can create deterrents from an objective. I’m expecting to not only utilize this in my current position but future positions. There’s no back up plan. I have already been immersed in this sect of employment not by force, but by choice because it still remains to be a passion to date as it was taking a part desktops, playing Leisure Suit Larry on Win 3.11 and looking for piracy in IRC rooms
